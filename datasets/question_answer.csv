If you forget to perform your peer grading it is not nice to your fellow students, but you can still pass that lab for which you forgot to grade.   Handing in and peer grading six of the eight labs reports is required for being able to execute the project and eventually pass the course. If a hand-in is not passed you will be contacted with the option of re-submitting the lab directly to the teacher so if you hear nothing assume that you have passed the lab. You can also contact the teacher directly on Slack if something went wrong with the submission of the lab. Peergrade deadlines are strict so no need to write about getting an extension. The following reports should be handed in jupyter notebook format. The weeks refer to weeks in term, and the fall break week is not counted. 1. Week 1 computer exercise. Deadline: Monday week 2. 2.

In what ways can the use of probabilistic simulations enhance the development of magnetic materials and configurations?,"(e.g. wind turbines, electric vehicles) but our ability to design novel magnetic materials and configurations is limited if we use non-probabilistic simulations. Taking clever advantage of the inductive biases built into physical laws, we can design and implement novel architectures that accurately predict fields around magnets. In this project, the student(s) might choose to: i) build a generative architecture for modelling two- and three-dimensional magnetic systems; ii) implement a Bayesian architecture that allows for uncertainty or missing data; or iii) consider the use of magnetic potentials, i.e. scalar functions from which the fields can be derived through (automatic) differentiation.

By tracking individual particles and fitting paths to their position in time, that adheres to conservation laws, a very good representation of a given flow is achieved. However, the current methods for determining whether what is seen in the image is indeed a particle, a very naïve approach is taken that simply looks for an intensity threshold.

However, the current methods for determining whether what is seen in the image is indeed a particle, a very naïve approach is taken that simply looks for an intensity threshold. This method is not nearly as good as the human eye at detecting particles, since their shape and brightness vary quite a bit. In this project, the student would attempt to produce a new method for particle detection in a 2D-image in such a way that the method produces more positive identifications of particles in a more reliable manner than the existing method.

However, by considering simple approximations of it we can obtain tractable distributions in the output space which we can then study to understand the behavior in the general case.

Through alternative splicing each gene in the human genome can produce multiple protein isoforms with distinct biological function. While gene-expression data is abundant, isoform expression is not. We have recently shown isoforms are understudied and present a huge opportunity in modern science. In many instances it is however not possible to re-quantify transcriptomics data with isoform resolution due to technical, practical and privacy issues. Therefore, we would like you to create a ML method which predicts isoform expression from gene expression. Specifically, you would use vast amounts of RNA-seq data as input to a VAE to extract informative gene-expression representations. Next you will train a DNN to predict isoform expression using these representations of a smaller training data as input. The project can, optionally, be extended using scGPT for gene representation.

More info can be found in the Project’s GitHub repository: https://github.com/sdea/AIStudentProjects/edit/main/README.md 29.  Prediction of protein isoforms using semi-supervised learning. Through alternative splicing each gene in the human genome can produce multiple protein isoforms with distinct biological function. While gene-expression data is abundant, isoform expression is not. We have recently shown isoforms are understudied and present a huge opportunity in modern science. In many instances it is however not possible to re-quantify transcriptomics data with isoform resolution due to technical, practical and privacy issues. Therefore, we would like you to create a ML method which predicts isoform expression from gene expression. Specifically, you would use vast amounts of RNA-seq data as input to a VAE to extract informative gene-expression representations. Next you will train a DNN to predict isoform expression using these representations of a smaller training data as input. The project can, optionally, be extended using scGPT for gene representation.

Next you will train a DNN to predict isoform expression using these representations of a smaller training data as input. The project can, optionally, be extended using scGPT for gene representation. The project will be co-supervised by Jes Frellsen (jefr@dtu.dk) and Kristoffer Vitting-Seerup (krivi@dtu.dk). 30. Deep Learning-based Image Coding Enhancement. Consider a scenario where we want to send an image from one device to another. We will encode the image on the transmitter, send the data through a noisy channel, and decode it on the receiver side. This encoding and decoding are traditionally done by mathematical-based algorithms. Starting a couple of years ago, researchers started using DNNs to do the task. A novel that got a lot of attention in this area is described in E. Bourtsoulatze, D. B. Kurka and D.

The images that the autoencoder trained on are of size 32x32 pixels, and the performance drops down as we increase the size. One approach is to partition a larger image into blocks of 32x32 and send them one by one and at the end, put them back together. But the idea here is to identify which parts of the image contain more information and which parts just have a few (like a solid background part of an image). Thereafter, 31. we can send the parts containing more information with more data and the parts having less information with less data to get a better overall performance in total.

The goal is to familiarize students with the concepts used in TinyML and model optimization. Many devices around us are not as powerful as our PCs. As examples, we can name different microcontrollers, mobile phones, FPGAs, Raspberry Pi, etc. These devices are very limited in terms of memory, computation power, and in some cases energy. In this project, we are going to learn the techniques that can be used to make a model small. Please take a look at the lecture Dr. Song Han had at Stanford [2] to get a better understanding of this research field.
